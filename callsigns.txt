 *** APRS Callsigns ***

APRS was originally built on top of AX.25, which limited each station to
a six character callsign with an additional four bit secondary station
identifier (SSID). This limit still exists on AX.25, but APRS stations
operating exclusively on the APRS-IS Internet system isn't as limited

Callsigns for AX.25 must:
 * Consist of only upper case letters and numbers
 * Have a base callsign before the SSID at least three characters long
 * Have a numeric SSID which falls in 0 - 15
 * Have a base callsign before the SSID no longer than six characters

Callsigns for APRS must:
 * Consist of only upper case letters and numbers
 * Be at least three characters long preceeding the optional '-SSID'
 * Optionally include one hyphen with a 1-2 character alphanumeric SSID suffix
 * Be no longer than nine characters in total
 * Not include the -0 SSID, since that is implicit in a lack of an SSID

Callsigns should be:
 * Globally unique

The APRS limitation of nine characters causes confusion as to if base
callsigns of lengths 7-9 are allowed.

In this context alphanumeric is defined as any ASCII values in the range:
 * decimal [65 - 90] - 'A'-'Z'
 * decimal [48 - 57] - '0'-'9'

In addition to legally identifying callsigns and tactical calls, APRS
defines additional calls which fall in these categories:
 * Blacklisted callsigns
 * Terminal Node Controller Identifiers
 * Routing aliases
 * Special handling tokens


 *** Blacklisted Callsigns ***

The following callsigns are used for documentation and should be dropped
or disallowed as early as possible if a user attempts to use them for their
station callsign:
 * NOCALL
 * N0CALL
 * MYCALL


 *** Terminal Node Controller Identifiers ***

The destination station field may optionally be used to identify the hardware
or software being used, in which case the destination callsign will begin with
"AP". Experimental devices may use the "APZ" prefix without contacting Bob B.

 *** Routing Aliases ***

Many callsigns may be used in the routing path to request service from
groups of digipeaters instead of individual specific digipeaters.
Each of these aliases consists of one to five characters, an 'n' original
hop specifier, and an 'N' hops remaining specifier as the SSID.
 * Neither n nor N may be greater than seven.
 * n must always be greater than or equal to N
 * N must be decremented by every digipeater handling a packet

The most widely supported alias is WIDEn-N

Many regions standardize on additional local aliases, which are often referred
to as SSn-N aliases, since the idea originated with state-wide groups for
smaller east coast states. These groups allow local users to flood the network
with SS7-7 aliases without packets traveling outside the intended service area.
See your local regional APRS interest group for more information.


 *** Special Handling Tokens ***

The last hop in a routing path may be a special handling token, which
instructs other stations to handle the packet in a specific way:
 * RFONLY - Do not I-gate this packet to the APRS-IS backbone
 * NOGATE - Do not I-gate this packet to the APRS-IS backbone
 * TCPIP - Packet originated from Internet source, do not I-gate
 * TCPXX - Packet originated from unverified Internet source (?), do not I-gate. Deprecated?
