Stephen Smith often claims that he invented the WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1 scheme
used for most mobile trackers in the modern APRS network.
I instead credit the inovation to both him and Wes Johnston.

On the issue of how to combine home digi first-hop-assist with true 
WIDEn-N systems without using first-hop RELAY:


How about a path of    "WIDE1-1, WIDE1-1"    or    "WIDE1-1, WIDE2-2"    ??


Set the alias of the former home "RELAY" digi to WIDE1-1 instead.   If a 
"dumb" home former-RELAY-type digi does the first digipeat, it marks 
WIDE1-1 as used. 

Then the true WIDEn-N digi(s) get a shot at the second part of the 
path.   I assume that in the absence of a nearby home digi, a "real" 
WIDEn-N would digi the first hop, then the WIDE2-2 part would cause two 
more digipeats.    

The path is compatible with either    first-hop-via-home-station,   or 
with all hops via    n-N-only    true wides and preserves exclusively 
dupe-supressing WIDEn-N type paths.


[ BTW,   Here in L.A. the monster mountaintop digis are now swallowing 
WIDE2-2 on a single hop.  Before that was implemented,  when I  was just 
driving around the greater L.A. area, I would routinely set WIDE1-1 into 
my mobile UI-View setup to get into the WIDEn-N-only digipeaters with an 
absolute minimum of dupes.   In my experience, ONE hop from a high digi 
will get into an igate from anywhere in the greater L.A. area.  ]

Subject: [aprssig] Re: Actually, the WIDE2-1,WIDE1-1 solution!

I think I have it!

A mobile station running W1-1,W2-2 gives 3 hops minimum becuase
W1-1,W1-1 would cause every home station in town to TX....  But there is
a real case for running less than 3 hops... If a mobile wants to limit
his path to fewer than 3 hops, he can "dummy up" a reduced Wn-n count by
using W2-1 instead of W2-2.

I still think RELAY stations switching to W1-1 is a good idea.

We could have three recommended paths for mobiles:
W2-2       ->two hops off digis, if you can hit 1st digi direct
W1-1,W2-1  ->one hop off house or digi, one more hop off digi
W1-1,W2-2  ->one hop off house or digi, two more hops off digis

In other words, if you want one hop, we have a solution.... WIDE1-1
If you want two hops, we have a solution W1-1,W2-1
If you want three hops, we have a solution W1-1,W2-2
if you want four hops, we have a solution W1-1,W3-3

And.... W2-2 still works everywhere because all digipeaters will respond
to it.
